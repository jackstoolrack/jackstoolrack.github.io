What is the JacksToolRack.com? It is all things home improvement and DIY - tricks, tips, and tool reviews and guides.
</p>
<p>
My name is Arron. I am a DIY enthusiast. I love working on my home improvement projects. My lovely wife Sara says it has become my obsession (her words, not mine).
</p>
<p>
I love testing the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/jackstoolrack/">latest power tools and gadgets</a> from the top brands. At one point I realized that I should start writing down my opinions about items I have tested or am planning to buy (or suggest you refrain from buying).
</p>
<p>
That’s how Jack’s Tool Rack was born.
